	<p align="center">Pulp Fiction written in 1994 is Quinten Tarantino's 3<sup>rd</sup> directed movie<br>
		     and is considered to be one of his greatest films to date. Pulp Fiction is<br>
			 comprised of a few seperate story lines that are chopped into segments and mixed<br> 
			 together both chronologically and by story line. It tells the story of two hitmen, <br>
			 <i>Jules Winnfield</i> and <i>Vincent Vega</i>, both of whom work for a mysterious<br>
			 boss known as Marsellus Wallace (who does <i><b>NOT</b></i> look like a b#tch).<br/>
	</p>
			 
	<p align="center"> The second story line follows professional boxer <i>Butch Coolidge</i>. The peak<br> 
			 of this story occurs when Butch is being paid by Marsellus Wallace to purposly<br>
			 get beat for a large sum of money. <i>Butch</i> not only doesn't throw the fight,<br>
			 but kills his opponent in the ring and flees the country with his girlfriend<br>
			 <i>Fabienne</i>.
